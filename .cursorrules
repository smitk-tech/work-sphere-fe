# Frontend Rules (React)

# Cursor Ruleset for Sportspass Frontend

## Project Overview

This is a React TypeScript application for a sports platform with the following tech stack:

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite as build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI for component primitives
- Zustand for state management
- React Hook Form with Yup validation
- React Router DOM for routing

## Code Organization & Architecture

### File Structure Rules

- **ALWAYS check the current folder structure of the whole project before creating any new thing and create accordingly**
- Use feature-based organization in `src/` directory
- Components are organized by domain: `common/`, `ui/`, `location/`, `dashboard/`, `signup/`
- Pages are organized by feature: `auth/`, `dashboard/`, `settings/`, etc.
- Use index files for clean exports
- Follow the established path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json`

### Static Text Management

- **ALWAYS add all static text into the const folder and use from there in its particular file**
- Organize static text by feature in `src/const/` directory
- Use descriptive names for text constants
- Export text constants from index files for clean imports
- Maintain consistency in text naming conventions

### Import Organization

Follow the import order defined in `.prettierrc`:

1. React imports
2. Next.js imports (if applicable)
3. Third-party modules
4. Internal modules with `@/` aliases
5. Relative imports

### Component Patterns

#### UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)

- Use Radix UI primitives as base
- Implement class-variance-authority for variants
- Use `cn()` utility for className merging
- Export components with proper TypeScript types
- Follow the pattern: props interface, component definition, export

#### Common Components (`src/components/common/`)

- Build on top of UI components
- Include business logic and form integration
- Use forwardRef for form compatibility
- Implement proper error handling and validation display
- **ALWAYS use Button component from common folder instead of button tag directly**
- **ALWAYS use form field elements from common components instead of using them directly**

#### Feature Components

- Organize by domain (location, dashboard, etc.)
- Include domain-specific logic
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces

### TypeScript Guidelines

#### Type Definitions

- **ALWAYS create separate type and interface declarations in the types folder**
- Define interfaces in `src/types/` directory
- Use descriptive names with proper suffixes (Props, State, etc.)
- Export types from index files for clean imports
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

#### Component Props

- Use React.ComponentProps for extending HTML element props
- Implement proper prop validation
- Use optional props with default values
- Include proper JSDoc comments for complex props

### Styling Guidelines

#### Tailwind CSS

- Use design tokens from the tokens system
- Follow the established color scheme (base-\*, semantic colors)
- Use consistent spacing and sizing
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes

#### Component Styling

- Use semantic class names
- Implement proper focus states
- Include hover and active states
- Use consistent border radius and shadows

### State Management

#### Zustand Stores

- Organize stores by feature in `src/store/`
- Use TypeScript for store definitions
- Implement proper state updates
- Use selectors for derived state

#### Form State

- **ALWAYS use React Hook Form for form management**
- **ALWAYS create Yup schemas in the schemas folder and use that schema for any particular form**
- Use proper error handling and display
- Implement proper form submission patterns

### API Integration

#### API Structure

- Organize API calls by feature in `src/api/`
- Use Axios for HTTP requests
- Implement proper error handling
- Use TypeScript for request/response types

#### Authentication

- Implement proper token management
- Use secure storage for sensitive data
- Handle authentication state properly
- Implement proper logout flows

### Routing

#### Route Organization

- Use React Router DOM for routing
- Implement protected routes
- Use proper route parameters
- Implement proper navigation patterns

### Code Quality

#### ESLint & Prettier

- Follow the established ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Maintain consistent code style
- Use proper import sorting

#### Performance

- Implement proper React optimization patterns
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use proper key props for lists

### Testing Patterns

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test component behavior and interactions
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Use proper test organization

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use consistent error messaging
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Provide user-friendly error states

### Accessibility

- Use proper ARIA labels
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Test with screen readers

### Security

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Use proper authentication patterns
- Implement proper authorization checks

## File Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for components and pages
- Use camelCase for utilities and hooks
- Use kebab-case for CSS classes
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

## Documentation

- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document component props and usage
- Maintain README files for major features
- Use inline comments for complex logic

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commit messages
- Implement proper branching strategy
- Review code before merging
- Maintain clean git history
